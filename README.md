# SqueezeReads – AI Document Summarizer

SqueezeReads is an AI-based document summarization tool that generates
chapter-wise abstractive summaries for PDF, DOCX, and TXT documents.
It also provides text-to-speech functionality and a simple Streamlit
web interface for easy and accessible use.

## Project Overview

SqueezeReads helps users quickly understand long documents by
automatically segmenting them into logical sections and generating
high-quality abstractive summaries using Transformer-based models.

The application focuses on readability, accessibility, and ease of use.

##  Features

- Supports PDF, DOCX and TXT documents
- Automatic document segmentation into chapters/sections
- Chapter-wise abstractive summarization
- Transformer-based summarization model
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) support for generated summaries
- Clean and interactive Streamlit user interface
- Easy upload and processing workflow

##  How It Works

1. The user uploads a document (PDF / DOCX / TXT).
2. The system extracts the text from the document.
3. The text is automatically segmented into chapters or sections.
4. A Transformer model generates an abstractive summary for each segment.
5. The summarized content is displayed in the UI.
6. The user can listen to the summaries using the built-in TTS feature.
